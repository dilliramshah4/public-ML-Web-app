Multiple Disease Prediction System using ML



ðŸ’¡ Project Overview:
"I developed and deployed a machine learning web app for disease prediction using Streamlit, which allows users to predict diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s based on input data."
ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
Scikit-learn (ML model training)
Joblib (model serialization)
Pandas & NumPy (data processing)
Streamlit (interactive web app deployment)
ðŸ“Œ Key Features & Impact:
Users input medical data, and the app predicts diseases in real time
Utilized pre-trained ML models (.sav files) for accuracy & efficiency
Showcased ML model integration into real-world applications
ðŸš€ What I Learned:
"This project helped me apply ML concepts in a practical setting, improving my understanding of data handling, model deployment, and user interaction."
